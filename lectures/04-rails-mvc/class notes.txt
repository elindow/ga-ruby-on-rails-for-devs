MVC

model-view-controller

crud
create retrieve update destroy

Test environment (not used)

class Duck
	def quack!  # or quack?
		true
	end
end

class DuckTest > ActiveSupport::TestCase
	test "duck quacks" do
		assert Duck.new.quack?
	end
end

people don't like this, too functional, boring ... doesn't express well

rspec

BDD behavior driven development

stories and scenarios (more complex)

describe Duck do
	it "should quack" do
		Duck.new.quack.should_be_true
	end
end
 declare what a duck is first
describe Duck do
	let(:duck) {duck.new}
	it "should quack" do
		Duck.should_
		quack
	end
end

if duck is swimming

describe Duck do
	let(:duck) {duck.new}
	it "should quack" do
	
		Duck.should_
		quack
		
		context "swimming" do
			before :each do
				duck.swim!
			end
	end
end
